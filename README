Javaglue is a Java->C/C++ code generator that is automatic and
full-featured.  Javaglue now also includes Rhino to provide
Javascript->Java, which then supports Javascript->Java->C++.

The javaglue script illustrates all required build steps.  The script
should be usable in a larger build process.  Compiling may or may not
be desired depending on complexity of dependencies.  Current output
includes jar files and shared libraries.

Tested on MacOSX so far.  Linux should be working or easily fixed.
Windows should work given a Bash environment.
